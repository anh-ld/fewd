      Hi my name is Meghan Curry. In my spare time, I like to hike and camp with my
      family, because the pacific north west is so beautiful. I also love to travel,
      last year we went to Cuba and Belize and next year we are going to Kenya and
      Tazania. On the weekend, I perform at children's birthdays doing magic shows,
      face painting and twisting balloon animals.
