    <h2>The Sleeping Pig</h2>
    <pre>
      It is easy to love a pig in a nightgown.
      See how he sleeps, white flannel
      straining his neck at the neckhole.
      His body swells and then deflates.
      The gown is nothing to be ashamed of, only
      the white clay of moonlight smeared
      over his hulk, original clothing, the milk
      of his loneliness. The flickering candle
      of a dream moves his warty eyelids.
      All sleeping things are children.
